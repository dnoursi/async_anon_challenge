# Async Anon Machine Learning Challenge 

The follow repository contains a sample training dataset from Prosper's Lending Platform on approximately 100k issued loans. It includes features such as the borrower's credit rating, debt to income ratio, as well as Prosper's estimate of the creditworthiness of the borrower. Your job is to use these features to predict whether the borrower will default on each of the loans. The loan default is encoded in the "LoanStatus" variable where 1 indicates a default and a 0 indicates a completed loan. 

Your model will be tested using the provided test dataset. Notice the "LoanStatus" column is missing- your job is to generate these predictions! They will be compared to the actual values, which are currently hidden.

It is recommended that you use Python3 for this challenge; sample code is provided in the repository. However, feel free to use any programming environment you like if there is a specific stack that you prefer.
